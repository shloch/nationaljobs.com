- put an image in front of the gender input (just like email input); do same for {select account type}
- better style submit buttons
- create 2 folders for edit profile ('personal' + 'organisation') in the view folder; and 'editProfile' subfolder
   to differenciate their view pages
-put script of editPersonal informations for 'personal' in a script file
- change loading image (later)
-remove {editing of user informations} and putting it in separate controllers; so we dont saturate the login controller
 we'll have to create 2 controllers for that; one for {personal user infos} and another controller for {edit enterprise infos}
-change design of {edit profile} menu links
-the date picker design should be changed to gray (to match the site's design)
-we should have another table listing "industry types"
-(in time) load ALL member infos into session
-comment on ALL controllers about what they do, on top
- (AT THE END)-->convert all queies to Active records
